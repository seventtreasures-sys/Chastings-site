                Tall, dark, and handsome, is one way to describe the man who has
                laid nearly exclusive claim to the title of 'Baron of Chastings
                Valley', though most of the living would prefer to focus on his
                lack of life and occasional use of darker magics. Most of his
                family and the castle staff tend to view him with some degree of
                pity when he isn't looking.

                Josandus' twin sister, and mother to two. Her husband died years
                ago fighting the Scourge in Northrend; she is reserved but it's
                unclear if this is because of her loss or simply a permanent
                facet of her personality. Like her twin she is tall though she
                is generally more muscular, a fact made obvious despite her
                tendency to walk the castle in casual gowns. Her and her
                children are the only known Hartchordes to have escaped undeath
                so far.

                The family's pragmatic engineer/mechanic responsible for general
                infrastructure.
              </td>
              <td>
                Generally accepted to be the wild child and black sheep of Jo's
                generation of Hartchordes. He isn't quite as tall as Jo, but
                more than makes up for that shortness with slouching. His hair
                is cut into a needlessly fashionable style, with shorn sides and
                the top and back longer, though he doesn't tease the long hair
                into spikes. His arms are adorned in colorful sleeves of
                tattoos, one side depicts various engineering details, while the
                other is a constantly steaming collection of holy iconography
                depicted in a stained glass style. His dress sets him apart from
                the rest of his family also as he typically wears either
                overalls or coveralls, with heavy boots and goggles either on
                his head or dangling from his neck. When he isn't on task, he
                typically stays down in the Blacksmith's residence.

                the Valley's information.
              </td>
              <td>
                Slight of build and shorter than all her siblings though still
                reaching a respectable five foot seven inches in height,
                Castillah is very obviously the youngest of her siblings. Though
                this notion is only reinforced by her death at the tender age of
                nineteen. She carries herself very similarly to Josandus; though
                where Jo's poise is natural and easy, Castillah's is full of
                nervous energy and often times a thinly veiled indignation. That
                isn't to say she's cold, she at least attempts to make a
                friendly first impression despite misfortune. Whereas Jane's
                dress is more casual, Castillah always wears a full ball gown
                complete with frills, petticoats and the full nine yards; her
                long black curls are always on display though they may be up or
                down.

                guidance on a variety of topics. Set to be the Baron's heir.

        <h1 class="title">The Distinguished Staff</h1>
        <p class="description">
          Hartchorde Castle relies on a dedicated team, blending the best of the
          living and the undead to provide peerless service.
        </p>

        <ul class="staff-list">
          <li>
            <span class="staff-name">Mr. Hastley:</span> The head butler, and
            indeed an immaculate, incomparable butler. Somehow, he's always
            steps away when needed, and bearing what you wanted before you even
            knew you wanted it. Beside this paragon of competency Josandus is
            but a bumbling child. Mustachioed and always suited, the fact that
            the large man is undead tends to fall by the wayside; it is simply
            irrelevant in the face of his feats of hospitality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="staff-name">Mrs. Tuttie:</span> The head chef of the
            castle, or some might say supreme dictator of the kitchens so long
            as she wasn't in earshot. A rather portly undead, but she makes it
            work somehow. Has been known to usher many a culinarily curious
            Harthchorde out from her hallowed halls.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="staff-name"
              >Miss Marie Ann and Miss Bonnie Fondston:</span
            >
            Two ghostly maids who work hard to keep the castle clean. Marie is
            friendly, but her main claim to fame is the speed with which she can
            clean a bedroom and then promptly take a nap in the room's bed; she
            has slept in every single bed in the castle. Bonnie is a veritable
            ray of sunshine wrought from ectoplasm; she will gladly share all of
            Marie's findings concerning the various furnishings with anyone who
            has even the slightest interest; however she becomes quite
            melancholy when asked about the time before Josandus' return.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="staff-name">Mr. Jordan Browning:</span> One of the
            butlers of the castle. A living man with green eyes and tawny brown
            hair. He's trying his hardest, but the stress of trying to emulate
            Mr. Hastley shows from time to time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="staff-name">Metrick:</span> A surly living kitchen
            aide. He frequently spouts statements that are offensive to more
            sensitive undead, which usually lands him in hot water with someone
            nearby. He does at least seem to be trying to not be a total
            asshole.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="staff-name">Silas Fondston:</span> The blacksmith.
            Unrepentant asshole and drunk. Will most likely throw a hammer at
            you unless you happen to be Bonnie.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="staff-name">Mrs. Trost:</span> Stooped and hunched and
            rarely seen outside of her classroom, this old woman is the mage
            hired on to teach the people of Chastings about magic. She is never
            seen without her trusty pointed hat and squat staff that seems to
            also serve as a walking cane.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 class="title">The Covert "Foxguard"</h1>
        <p class="description">
          To achieve his ambitions in a political landscape rife with spies,
          assassins, and competing factions, the Baron maintains a secret,
          highly specialized security force known as the Foxguard.
        </p>

        <div class="foxguard-section">
          <h3 class="foxguard-heading">Covert Operations:</h3>
          <p>
            The Foxguard are Josandus' personal, clandestine agents, focusing on
            intelligence gathering, blackmail, sabotage, and eliminating key
            threats to the Harthchorde interests. They operate entirely outside
            the jurisdiction of the castle guard, maintaining extreme secrecy.
          </p>

          <h3 class="foxguard-heading">Specialist:</h3>
          <p>
            Within the organization, the most specialized members are known as
            wet-persons (a term for assassins or those who perform "wet work,"
            meaning involving bloodshed). These agents are meticulously trained
            in silent killing, poisoning, and infiltration, ensuring the Baron's
            hands remain clean and his political rivals meet with "unfortunate
            accidents."
          </p>

          <h3 class="foxguard-heading">Recruitment and Loyalty:</h3>
          <p>
            The Foxguard is likely composed of undead and morally flexible
            living individuals whose loyalty is guaranteed by a mixture of coin,
            dark promises, or even subtle magical compulsion from the Baron
            himself.
