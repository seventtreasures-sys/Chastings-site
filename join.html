          A Summons to Service: The Barony of Chastings Seeks Loyal Hearts
        </h2>
        <p class="byline">
          By Decree of Baron Josandus J. Hartchorde, Lord of Chastings Valley
        </p>

        <p>
          Hear ye, citizens, artisans, and brave souls throughout the kingdoms!
          <br />
          <br />
          The ancient Barony of Chastings has risen from the shadow of the
          Scourge. We have reclaimed our ancestral lands and initiated the grand
          effort to restore this Valley to its former glory—and surpass it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We seek skilled, loyal, and discreet individuals to join our ranks and
          secure the future of our domain. Chastings is not merely a territory;
          it is a bastion of Lordaeronian history and a cradle for a new,
          powerful future.
        </p>

        <h3>The Mission: Securing the Rebirth</h3>
        <p>
          Chastings Valley requires aid on all fronts. Your duty, should you
          pledge to the Baron, will encompass two vital areas:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"> Restoration & Prosperity</span>: We need hands
          to rebuild, minds to organize, and innovation to thrive.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"> Defense and Security</span> The political
          landscape is treacherous, and the wilderness is often hostile. We
          require stout defenses against those who would invade our borders, be
          they political rivals or wartime aggressors.
        </p>

        <h3>Open Call For All Professions and Skills</h3>
        <p>
          We are actively recruiting across all vocations. The rewards for
          service are substantial, and the purpose is profound.

        <h3>Specialized Cases: The Unconventional Agents</h3>
        <p>
          Certain powers are viewed with suspicion by the outside world, yet
          they hold unmatched utility in a time of necessary action. Individuals
          skilled in the darker arts or bearing the taint of unconventional
          sacrifice may find a critical, if discreet, purpose within the Barony.
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul class="staff-list">
          <li>
            Necromancers and Shadow Priests: Employed in controlled environments
            for research, defense, and specialized tasks under strict
            supervision.
          </li>
          <li>
            Former Scourge Affiliates: Those who have renounced their past
            allegiances and seek redemption through service to the Barony may be
            considered for specific roles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Warlocks: Your capacity to control volatile magic and summon
            powerful allies is invaluable for defending the Valley's deepest
            secrets. Discretion is paramount.
          </li>
          <li>
            Demon Hunters: Your unique skills are necessary to hunt threats
            others cannon perceive. Your service will be utilized under special
            mandate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Death Knights: Your grim resilience and martial power are unmatched.
            You will serve as the heavy hand of the Valley Guard when diplomacy
            fails. Secondary responsibilities assigned if you pursue the art of
            psychopompacy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To ensure the safety and stable future of our Valley, all prospective
          citizens and agents must take this solemn oath:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="emphasis">
          You shall not, under any circumstances, involve the resources or
          forces of Chastings Valley in foreign or non-domestic conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our focus is singular: The security, restoration, and ultimate
          prosperity of Chastings and the Hartchorde legacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not be drawn into the endless squabbles of distant kingdoms.
          Our loyalty lies with our own walls. Those who pledge themselves to
          this ideal are invited to present themselves at the Hartchorde
          Gatehouse or contact Baron Hartchorde's Emissary in Saleswick to begin
          their path to service.

        <p class="emphasis">The Baron's Political Ambitions</p>

        <p>
          Baron Josandus Hartchorde views the current political climate in
          Lordaeron as a temporary power vacuum, despite the establishment of
          the Forsaken's Desolate Council and the Alliance's recent efforts to
          reclaim territory like Gilneas and Stromgarde. His core objectives
          are:
        </p>
        <ul class="staff-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimacy and Restoration</strong>: He aims to leverage the
            Hartchorde's ancient nobility and long-standing presence in
            Chastings Valley to position himself as a "rightful" Lordaeronian
            noble who remained and rebuilt, unlike many who fled. His goal is
            not to align entirely with the Alliance's Stormwind-centric goals,
            but to restore Lordaeron as a powerful, independent kingdom where
            the ancient noble houses—including the undead nobility—hold sway.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Undead Question</strong>: As an undead noble, he seeks
            to bridge the gap between the living Lordaeronian refugees and the
            Forsaken, seeing the undead as the true inheritors and original
            citizens of the kingdom. However, his use of darker magics means he
            is viewed with suspicion by both the living Alliance and the more
            politically moderate Forsaken leadership like Calia Menethil. He
            likely seeks to co-opt or destabilize the Desolate Council to assert
            his own dominance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Expansion and Influence</strong>: The continued renovation
            and economic revival of Chastings Valley and its numerous towns are
            a show of force, demonstrating that the Hartchordes can govern and
            bring prosperity where others have failed. This is the foundation
            upon which he plans to claim wider influence over the surrounding
            territories.
